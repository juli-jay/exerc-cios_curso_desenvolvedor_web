                    Well, I've been waking up under blades, blueblossom days
                    If only Damocles would hit me back
                    No alabaster carvings or faces on a farthing
                    Would prevent my head from fading to black
                    
                    And it feels like falling into the sea
                    From outer space in seconds to me
                    And I play discordant days on repeat
                    Until they look like harmony
                    
                    When the river runs dry and the curtain is called
                    How will I know if I can't see the bottom?
                    Come up for air and choke on it all
                    No one else knows that I've got a problem
                    What if I can't get up and stand tall?
                    What if the diamond days are all gone?
                    And who will I be when the empire falls?
                    Wake up alone and I'll be forgotten
                    
                    Well, I know I should be touring
                    I know these chords are boring
                    But I can't always be killing the game
                    No golden grand pianos or voices from the shadows
                    Will do anything but feel the same
                    
                    And it feels like falling into the deep
                    From somewhere way up over the peaks
                    And I play discordant days on repeat
                    Until the tape runs out on me
                    
                    When the river runs dry and the curtain is called
                    How will I know if I can't see the bottom?
                    Come up for air and choke on it all
                    No one else knows that I've got a problem
                    What if I can't get up and stand tall?
                    What if the diamond days are all gone?
                    And who will I be when the empire falls?
                    Wake up alone and I'll be forgotten
                    
                    And nobody told me I'd be begging for relief
                    When what is silent to you feels like it's screaming to me
                    Well, nobody told me I'd get tired of myself
                    When it all looks like heaven, but it feels like hell
                    
                    When the river runs dry and the curtain is called
                    How will I know if I can't see the bottom?
                    Come up for air and choke on it all
                    No one else knows that I've got a problem
                    What if I can't get up and stand tall?
                    What if the diamond days are all gone?
                    And who will I be when the empire falls?
                    Wake up alone and I'll be forgotten
